Hydro is a high-level programming language specifically crafted for UI/GUI development. It aims to simplify the process of creating interactive and visually appealing user interfaces for various platforms. Whether you are building desktop applications or console applications, Hydro provides a unified and intuitive way to design and implement UIs.

## Features

- **Declarative Syntax**: Hydro uses a declarative syntax that makes it easy to describe the structure and behavior of your user interfaces. You can define UI components, their properties, and interactions in a clear and concise manner.

- **Cross-Platform**: Hydro is designed to be cross-platform, allowing you to target multiple platforms with a single codebase. You can create UIs that work seamlessly on desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), mobile (iOS, Android), and web browsers.

- **Component-Based**: Hydro promotes a component-based architecture, making it straightforward to create reusable UI components. This modularity enhances code maintainability and encourages best practices in UI design.

- **Rich Library Ecosystem**: Hydro comes with a rich library ecosystem that includes pre-built UI components, layout tools, and styling options. You can leverage these libraries to accelerate your development process.

- **Interactive and Dynamic**: Hydro supports interactive and dynamic UIs. You can easily add animations, transitions, and real-time updates to create engaging user experiences.

- **Strong Typing**: The language incorporates strong typing to catch errors at compile-time, reducing runtime issues and enhancing the reliability of your applications.
